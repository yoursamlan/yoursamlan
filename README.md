### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**yoursamlan/yoursamlan** is a âœ¨[Nxtbook](https://nxtbook.netlify.app), an updated new version of _ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working on** : [PerLib](https://perlib.netlify.app/) [*password:* demo], [VidLib](https://noobrook.netlify.app/), [Nxtbook](https://nxtbook.netlify.app), and many more projects, based on [pubsidian](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian), which I had created from scratch as a hobby project to host my obsidian notes, but turns out to be more powerful than I initially thought of ðŸ˜Œ.
- ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning** : [Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) methods of Bayesian Statistics
- ðŸ“š **Iâ€™m currently reading** : [An Era of Darkness: The British Empire in India by Shashi Tharoor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M5EEINV/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about** : [Chess](https://lichess.org/@/NoTimeToDie_007), [Indian Constitution](https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/COI.pdf) and [History of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_India#:~:text=The%20Mature%20Indus%20civilization%20flourished,Lothal%20in%20modern%2Dday%20India.).
- âš¡ **Fun fact**: **I am targeting 50K contributions by the end of this year.ðŸ™ƒ**

N.B: New version of [pubsidian](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian) CORE is coming soon. Please stay tuned. Thank you. ðŸ˜‡
